This project uses COVID-19 global datasets to explore and visualize pandemic trends and support basic prediction analysis using Tableau. The dataset includes multiple CSVs with COVID statistics from 2020–2025, such as case counts and testing policy data, and provides a foundation to understand how the pandemic affects societies. The work focuses on data exploration, trend visualization, and predictive insights, using Tableau to create interactive dashboards that highlight key patterns and changes over time.

Key features:

Cleaned and structured COVID-19 time-series data (cases, testing, policies).

Visual analysis with Tableau dashboards to reveal patterns in pandemic progression.

A predictive component that interprets trends and potential future trajectories based on historical data.

This project demonstrates skills in data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory analysis, suitable for data analytics and data science portfolios.
